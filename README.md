# JetsProject


This program holds a database of jets read in from a CSV. The menu allows the user to add and remove jets from the database as well as get lists and information about jets already in the database. The user can send all the troops to fight and load all the planes that can hold some cargo.

#Lessons learned

The database that I used was a .csv file. When I deleted the first line I inadvertently left a line blank. After hours of looking in the code for the error I discovered the space and deleted it. That will be the second place I look for errors in the future. The first being my initialization of the variables, (from last weeks project). 

This is a larger program with many classes compared to previous projects. I feel that I have a better understanding of how classes can work together and alone. Also, getting some practice with interfaces and abstracts was a challenge but I learned a lot. 

Working from a UML made breaking down the classes a bit easier and seeing how writing one and putting it into practice was interesting. I can see how they will be necessary in the real world.
